     <h2>My Hometown</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in the City of Hope, Duarte, California. Being raised in the mid 90's was fantastic, and the city and its neighboring cities were and still are great. California weather is perfect for going out to the nearby beaches, meeting new people and hanging out with friends. Only a 10 minute drive from Los Angeles, I got to experience the LA lifestyle without the heavier traffic. Got to eat some of the best street food, attend outdoor festivities, and how anything can happen on any given weekend. Some of my most favorites spots aside from restaturants, include Mount Wilson for hiking, old town Monrovia, and all the local parks.</p>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I consider myself a person with a plethora of interests and hobbies. With a passion and desire to continually learn and grow, I seek and challenge myself with exploring new opportunities and all the experiences that life has to offer. Thus, my daily interets and hobbies include working out, hiking, photography, traveling, video editing, streaming on Twitch, self growth books and spending as much time as possible with my family and friends. I love playing tennis, basketball, and other physically active activities. Love going to the beach and surrounding myself near any body of water.</p>

      <h2>UC Riverside</h2>
      <p>I am currently in my last quarter at UC Riverside. Although I transferred to UC Riverside during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I did not get experience the full in-person college lifestyle. However, I did decide to dorm on campus, experience living on campus and the overall college lifestyle. Considering I live an hour away from Riverside, exploring Riverside and its surrounding cities was an amazing first-hand experience. Made strong bonds with new college friends, faculty, and connected with outstanding college professors.</p>
